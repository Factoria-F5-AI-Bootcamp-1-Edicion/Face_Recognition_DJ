# Real time webcamp Face Recognition using Computer Vision.



## Description :speech_balloon:

This is a project of Face Recognition to identify people´s faces in real time using a webcam. We use our classmates faces from our AI Bootcamp class, to make the database. We started by building a Siamese Neural Network from scratch, we learned a lot about building NN but we wanted to scale the project in order to recognize many people from our class. The Siamese NN worked well but the resource consumption was too high, so that's why we decide to implement the Face-Recognition library which is a pre-trained model that saves a lot of computer power. We decide to include the NN document for research and study purposes.

## Getting Started :white_check_mark:

### Dependencies :construction::wrench:

* python 3.10
* webcam

### Executing program :checkered_flag:


```
* Install requirements.txt file
* To run the progam write "python main.py"
* The webcam will open and start making predictions in real time
* To add a new person to verify just add a 1000x1000.jpg image from her/his face to the "/faces" folder
```

## Help :heavy_exclamation_mark:

The "Face-recognition library can give problems to install. Make sure to have "cmake" and "dlib" previously installed in your machine
